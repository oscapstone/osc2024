/* 
(NOLOAD) :  means that this section should not be loaded into memory from the executable file because it's initialized to zero at runtime. 
PROVIDE() : used to avoid redefinition if .c files have defined the variable.
ALIGN() : ensures that the memory address at which a section begins is aligned to a 16-byte boundary.
