## Labs

* a cross-compiler for aarch64
* (optional) qemu-system-arm

### Lab 0: Environment Setup
In Lab 0, you need to prepare the environment for future development. You should install the target toolchain, and use them to build a bootable image for rpi3.
Goals of this lab:

* Set up the development environment.
* Understand the concept of cross-platform development.
* Test your rpi3.

### Lab 1: Hello World
In Lab 1, you will practice bare metal programming by implementing a simple shell. You need to set up mini UART, and let your host and rpi3 can communicate through it.

Goals of this lab:

* Practice bare metal programming.
* Learn how to access rpi3's peripherals.
* Set up the mini UART.
* Set up the mailbox.

### Lab 2: Booting
In Lab 2, you’ll learn one of the methods to load your kernel and user programs. Also, you’ll learn how to match a device to a driver on rpi3. The initialization of the remaining subsystems will be introduced at later labs.

Goals of this lab:

* Implement a bootloader that loads kernel images through UART
* Implement a simple allocator.
* Understand what’s initial ramdisk.
* Understand what’s devicetree.

### Lab 3: Exception and Interrupt
An exception is an event that causes the currently executing program to relinquish the CPU to the corresponding handler. With the exception mechanism, an operating system can

* do proper handling when an error occurs during execution.
* A user program can generate an exception to get the corresponding operating system’s service.
* A peripheral device can force the currently executing program to relinquish the CPU and execute its handler.

Goals of this lab:

* Understand what’s exception levels in Armv8-A.
* Understand what’s exception handling.
* Understand what’s interrupt.
* Understand how rpi3’s peripherals interrupt the CPU by interrupt controllers.
* Understand how to multiplex a timer.
* Understand how to concurrently handle I/O devices.

### Lab 4: Booting
In Lab 4, you need to implement memory allocators. They’ll be used in all later labs.

Goals of this lab:

* Implement a page frame allocator.
* Implement a dynamic memory allocator.
* Implement a startup allocator.
