## Labs

* a cross-compiler for aarch64
* (optional) qemu-system-arm

### Lab 0: Environment Setup
In Lab 0, you need to prepare the environment for future development. You should install the target toolchain, and use them to build a bootable image for rpi3.
Goals of this lab:

* Set up the development environment.
* Understand the concept of cross-platform development.
* Test your rpi3.

### Lab 1: Hello World
In Lab 1, you will practice bare metal programming by implementing a simple shell. You need to set up mini UART, and let your host and rpi3 can communicate through it.

Goals of this lab:

* Practice bare metal programming.
* Learn how to access rpi3's peripherals.
* Set up the mini UART.
* Set up the mailbox.

### Lab 2: Booting
In Lab 2, you’ll learn one of the methods to load your kernel and user programs. Also, you’ll learn how to match a device to a driver on rpi3. The initialization of the remaining subsystems will be introduced at later labs.

Goals of this lab:

* Implement a bootloader that loads kernel images through UART
* Implement a simple allocator.
* Understand what’s initial ramdisk.
* Understand what’s devicetree.

### Lab 3: Exception and Interrupt
An exception is an event that causes the currently executing program to relinquish the CPU to the corresponding handler. With the exception mechanism, an operating system can

* do proper handling when an error occurs during execution.
* A user program can generate an exception to get the corresponding operating system’s service.
* A peripheral device can force the currently executing program to relinquish the CPU and execute its handler.

Goals of this lab:

* Understand what’s exception levels in Armv8-A.
* Understand what’s exception handling.
* Understand what’s interrupt.
* Understand how rpi3’s peripherals interrupt the CPU by interrupt controllers.
* Understand how to multiplex a timer.
* Understand how to concurrently handle I/O devices.

### Lab 4: Allocator
In Lab 4, you need to implement memory allocators. They’ll be used in all later labs.

Goals of this lab:

* Implement a page frame allocator.
* Implement a dynamic memory allocator.
* Implement a startup allocator.

### Lab 5: Thread and User Process
Multitasking is the most important feature of an operating system. In this lab, you’ll learn how to create threads and how to switch between different threads to achieve multitasking. Moreover, you’ll learn how a user program becomes a user process and accesses services provided by the kernel through system calls.

Goals of this lab:

* Understand how to create threads and user processes.
* Understand how to implement scheduler and context switch.
* Understand what’s preemption.
* Understand how to implement POSIX signals.

### Lab 6: Virtual Memory
Virtual memory provides isolated address spaces, so each user process can run in its address space without interfering with others.

In this lab, you need to initialize the memory management unit(MMU) and set up the address spaces for the kernel and user processes to achieve process isolation

Goals of this lab:

* Understand ARMv8-A virtual memory system architecture.
* Understand how the kernel manages memory for user processes.
* Understand how demand paging works.
* Understand how copy-on-write works.

### Lab 7: Virtual File System
In this lab, you’ll implement a VFS interface for your kernel, and a memory-based file system (tmpfs) that mounts as the root file system, you’ll also implement special file for uart and framebuffer.

Goals of this lab:

* Understand how VFS interface works.
* Understand how to set up a root file system.
* Understand how to operate on files.
* Understand how to mount a file system and look up a file across file systems.
* Understand how special file works.
