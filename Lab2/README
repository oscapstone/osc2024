## About This Project

[Provide a brief description of the project, its goals, and how it's intended to be used. This section can help visitors understand the context and significance of your work.]

## How to Use

This project is organized into several directories, each serving a different purpose. Here's an overview of the key directories:

### Lab2

The `Lab2` directory contains the source code and resources for the second lab assignment. To build the files in this directory, navigate to `Lab2` and type the `make` command:

```bash
cd Lab2
make
```

A `build` directory will appear, containing three subdirectories, `bootloader`, `kernel`, and `peripherals`. Copy the `bootloader.img` in `bootloader` directory along with all the files in `firmware` directory into the SD card.

```bash
cd rootfs
find . | cpio -o -H newc > ../initramfs.cpio
```

This creates a cpio file for rootfs.

Examine contents within the cpio:

```bash
cpio -itv < initramfs.cpio
```

**IMPORTANT**
On mac running ubuntu on vm, use the following command:

```bash
find . -not -name '.DS_Store' | cpio -o -H newc > ../initramfs.cpio
```

Otherwise, the .DS_Store files created automatically by mac will be included within the
cpio archive, causing errors when parsing.

**ALSO VERY IMPORTANT**
If you directly create a cpio archive on native mac, the cpio format won't be the same as
the format on Ubuntu VM. This provided version is for Ubuntu, so native mac cpio will not
be parsed correctly.
