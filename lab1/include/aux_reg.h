// Physical addresses range from 0x3F000000 to 0x3FFFFFFF for peripherals. The
// bus addresses for peripherals are set up to map onto the peripheral bus address range
// starting at 0x7E000000. Thus a peripheral advertised here at bus address 0x7Ennnnnn is
// available at physical address 0x3Fnnnnnn.
